        I'm a student of Maths and Data Science at the University of Exeter. At time of writing, my journey through university 
        isn't looking to be the most traditional; but to me, that means I'll be that much more proud of myself when I'm done.

        The first time I ever seriously considered STEM as a path open to me was in Year 9, when I was told by one of my 
        teachers that I could likely go to university for Mathematics, if I wanted.

        7 years later, I'm beginning to move away from the highly theoretical path I first put myself on. Instead, I'm 
        turning my sights towards software engineering, a field I never expected to enjoy but have come to love over the 
        course of my work experience.

        In my free time, I'm a baker, boulderer, and player of strategy games. Thanks to growing up near the picturesque 
        Malvern Hills, I'm a big fan of dramatic landscapes, and I love exploring new places, from country to city (and 
        every museum they have to offer).
