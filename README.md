### Introduction

This project is an attempt by myself to begin my software portfolio by creating a platform/CV for myself on which to display my future work. 

Currently in its beta stages, the project currently has minimal functionality and content; I will be expanding this in the near future.

As the website is very much in its earliest stage, I welcome any and all feedback on it. Please check the list of issues attached to this repo to see what is in the website's future!

### Dependencies

This project uses Node.js, the Angular CLI v18 and TailwindCSS. As the project evolves, this dependency list will be updated.
